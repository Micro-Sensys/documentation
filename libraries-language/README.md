# Libraries (didived in programming languages)
//TODO divided in frameworks instead of languages?? (Windows native is not a language but more a framework!?)

This guide gives an overview of the different libraries available, using the basis programming language used as a way to create the following sub-guides. This can help some developers decide which one is the most apropriate for their knowledge

## Programming languages
Here is a list of links to the currently supported languages
* .NET Framework (for Windows desktop development) [see further details](/dotnet-framework)
* Java (for Android, Windows and UNIX systems in general) [see further details](/java)
* UWP (Universal Windows Platform, for Windows devices) [see further details](/uwp)
